console.log("Before fix:");
console.log("1. User signs in");
console.log("2. Dashboard component initializes");
console.log("3. loadUserProfile() is called");
console.log("4. loadReports() is called immediately (before userProfile is available)");
console.log("5. Reports don't load because userProfile is null");
console.log("6. User has to click refresh button to load reports");
console.log("");

console.log("After fix:");
console.log("1. User signs in");
console.log("2. Dashboard component initializes");
console.log("3. loadUserProfile() is called");
console.log("4. userProfile$ emits a value");
console.log("5. loadReports() is called only after userProfile is available");
console.log("6. Reports load automatically without needing to click refresh");
console.log("");

console.log("The fix ensures that reports are loaded only after the user profile is available,");
console.log("which resolves the issue of reports not showing up when the dashboard is first loaded.");
