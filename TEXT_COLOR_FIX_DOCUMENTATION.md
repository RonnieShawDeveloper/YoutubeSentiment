# Text Color Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

On the reports page, there were areas with white backgrounds where the text was also white, making it impossible to read. This issue was particularly noticeable in the report tabs where text was not visible.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a conflict between global styles and component-specific styles:

1. The global styles in `styles.css` set a light text color for the entire application:
   ```css
   html, body {
     color: #f5f3f6; /* Factory Stone Purple lightest (primary-50) */
   }
   ```

2. Additionally, all Material cards were styled to have light text:
   ```css
   .mat-mdc-card {
     color: #f5f3f6 !important; /* Factory Stone Purple lightest (primary-50) */
   }
   ```

3. However, the report component had elements with white or light gray backgrounds:
   ```css
   .report-tabs {
     background-color: white;
   }
   
   ::ng-deep .themes-accordion .p-accordion-content {
     background-color: white !important;
   }
   ```

4. The persona cards in the Audience Insights tab also had white backgrounds:
   ```html
   <div class="persona-card p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md border border-gray-200">
   ```

This combination resulted in white text on white backgrounds, making the text invisible.

## Solution

The solution was to add CSS rules to override the global text color for elements with white or light backgrounds in the reports page:

1. Added rules for persona cards with white backgrounds:
   ```css
   .persona-card.bg-white {
     color: #1f2937 !important; /* Dark gray text for better visibility */
   }
   
   .persona-card.bg-white h3,
   .persona-card.bg-white p,
   .persona-card.bg-white li,
   .persona-card.bg-white .text-sm {
     color: #1f2937 !important; /* Dark gray text for better visibility */
   }
   ```

2. Added rules for elements within report tabs:
   ```css
   .report-tabs .mat-mdc-tab-body-content {
     color: #1f2937 !important; /* Dark gray text for better visibility */
   }
   
   .report-tabs .mat-mdc-card-content {
     color: #1f2937 !important; /* Dark gray text for better visibility */
   }
   ```

3. Added rules for PrimeNG Accordion content:
   ```css
   ::ng-deep .themes-accordion .p-accordion-content {
     color: #1f2937 !important; /* Dark gray text for better visibility */
   }
   
   ::ng-deep .themes-accordion .p-accordion-content p,
   ::ng-deep .themes-accordion .p-accordion-content div,
   ::ng-deep .themes-accordion .p-accordion-content span,
   ::ng-deep .themes-accordion .p-accordion-content li {
     color: #1f2937 !important; /* Dark gray text for better visibility */
   }
   ```

4. Added general rules for any elements with white or light gray backgrounds:
   ```css
   .bg-white,
   .bg-gray-50,
   [class*="bg-white"],
   [class*="bg-gray-50"] {
     color: #1f2937 !important; /* Dark gray text for better visibility */
   }
   
   .bg-white *:not(.text-white):not([class*="text-primary"]):not([class*="text-secondary"]):not([class*="text-accent"]),
   .bg-gray-50 *:not(.text-white):not([class*="text-primary"]):not([class*="text-secondary"]):not([class*="text-accent"]) {
     color: #1f2937 !important; /* Dark gray text for better visibility */
   }
   ```

These changes ensure that all text on white or light gray backgrounds is dark and visible, while preserving any intentionally colored text.

## Future Considerations

For future development, consider:

1. Using a more consistent approach to text colors throughout the application
2. Avoiding the use of `!important` in global styles
3. Implementing a proper light/dark theme system that handles text colors appropriately
4. Testing text visibility on different background colors as part of the QA process
